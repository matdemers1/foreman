 * about to lose. That reasoning is about **citations**: deleting a requirement hides every
 * reference to it, and the loss is in the references, not the row — which is precisely what a
 * session issuing a tool call cannot see and a console screen shows.
 *

 * is a title and a paragraph, and the list is only useful if pruning it is as cheap as adding to
 * it — a backlog nobody empties is a backlog nobody reads. So this is narrowed to what nothing
 * cites rather than reversed wholesale (FRM-ADR-014, raised as `proposed`): the ADR's protection
 * stays exactly where its rationale applies, and every other kind still answers "from the console".

 * added to this list since. It is deletable here while a project is not, which is the distinction
 * the whole feature rests on: `PI-007` is a sentence somebody wrote down, and `BND` is nine
 * hundred records that cite each other.
