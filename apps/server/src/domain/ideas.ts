/**
 * Ideas — a thing somebody might build, before it is a plan
 * (FRM-REQ-153 … FRM-REQ-158).
 *
 * The shape is taken from the "Feature Ideas & Future Development" documents four projects already
 * carry, rather than invented: each sorts its entries into **Accepted**, **Parked** — *"good ideas,
 * deliberately not now"* — and **Rejected**, under the heading *"do not re-litigate these"*. So
 * those are the statuses, plus `new` for one nobody has judged.
 *
 * **A parked or rejected idea must say why.** That is the one rule here worth its weight: the
 * value of writing a rejection down is entirely that it is not re-argued six months later by
 * somebody who cannot tell it was already considered. Without the reason, a rejected idea is
 * indistinguishable from a forgotten one, and the list slowly refills with things already decided.
 * Same rule, and the same failure, as a blocked task that does not say what is blocking it.
