/**
 * The innovation-fund board: scoring, discussion and funding (FRM-ADR-016).
 *
 * Everything here is inert unless `FOREMAN_MODE=board`. The routes are mounted either way — a
 * feature that exists only in one build is a feature only one build has ever tested — but the
 * guards in front of them answer 404 in `solo`, so a personal instance is unchanged and its
 * console never offers any of it.
 *
 * **Three rules carry the weight, and all three are about who sees what.**
 *
 * 1. A submission is visible to everyone signed in. An innovation fund whose submissions are
 *    private produces the same idea six times and never lets anyone build on anyone else's.
 * 2. Scores are reviewers-only until the decision is made. A board that scores in public scores
 *    politically, and a submitter watching their idea sit at 2.1 learns nothing they can act on.
 * 3. The decision and its reason are public the moment they exist. This is the half people
 *    actually need, and the half most boards never write down.
