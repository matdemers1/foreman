 * Status rollup (FRM-REQ-183, FRM-REQ-184, FRM-REQ-185).
 *
 * Tasks are the only status anybody moves by hand in practice, so phase status and project
 * lifecycle rotted: Foreman's own FRM-P-11 read `planned` with every task done, and Postroom showed
 * thirteen `planned` phases, five of them at 100%. The brief had already stopped trusting the stored
 * value and worked out the phase in flight for itself — which is the tell that the stored value was
 * a second copy of a fact, kept by nobody.
 *
 * So the status is **derived from what is beneath it**, in the same transaction as the change that
 * moved it, and written as its own audit event so it can be read and undone like any other:
 *
 *   tasks  → phase    planned · active · complete (only through the exit gate) · cancelled
 *   phases → project  building · deployed — promotion only, never demotion
 *
 * **`parked` is the one decision a rollup never makes or unmakes.** It says "deliberately not now",
 * which no count of tasks can know. The same goes for a parked or scrapped project.
