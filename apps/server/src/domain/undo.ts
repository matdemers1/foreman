 * Soft delete and undo (FRM-REQ-138, FRM-REQ-139, FRM-REQ-140).
 *
 * **Nothing is unrecoverable.** Delete sets `deleted_at`; it never removes a row. Undo replays an
 * audit event's `before` — which is why the event is written in the same transaction as the change
 * it records, and why a mutation that cannot be recorded does not happen.
 *
 * The rule that makes undo safe: **a reversal is refused when the current state is not what the
 * event left behind.** Undoing a change that something else has since changed again would silently
 * discard the later edit, which is a worse outcome than refusing.
