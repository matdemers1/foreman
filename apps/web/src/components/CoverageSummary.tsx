/**
 * The state of a project's register, above its register.
 *
 * Two hundred and ten rows is the right answer to "show me the requirements" and no answer at all
 * to "is this register in good shape". The coverage engine already computes the four numbers that
 * answer it; this is them, and the ring says how close to covered the Musts are without anyone
 * dividing 156 by 160 in their head.
 *
 * The EARS figure is here rather than only on a row because it was invisible: every requirement
 * carried an attention badge with no explanation, and the count that would have made that legible
 * was computed and never shown.
