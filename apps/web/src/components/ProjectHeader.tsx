 * the word "Decision records" and a three-character link, so a reader two clicks deep could not
 * tell which project they were in without reading the URL, and the only route onwards was the
 * browser's back button.
 *
 * Three things, in the order they answer the reader's questions: **where am I** (the trail),
 * **whose is this** (the project, named, with its lifecycle), and **what is this** (the section).
